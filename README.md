Your intelligent content consumption vault

Stop letting saved links become digital graveyards. rem turns your "read later" list into a "read now" habit with smart reminders and beautiful organization.

## Why rem?

We all save content with the best intentions. Articles to read, videos to watch, books to finish. But without accountability, they disappear into the void.

rem fixes this by:

- **Smart reminders** that nudge you at the right time
- **Simple sharing** from any app on your phone
- **Clear progress** so you see your wins
- **Beautiful organization** that makes browsing enjoyable


## Features

### Save From Anywhere

Share links, images, or text directly to rem from any app. Works with your browser, social feeds, messaging apps, and more.

### Your Personal Queue

Everything you save appears in one clean, scannable list. Rich previews show titles, images, and descriptions so you know exactly what you're looking at.


### Smart Reminders

Set daily or weekly reminders at times that work for you. rem learns your habits and suggests the perfect moment to catch up on your reading.

- Snooze when busy
- Escalating nudges for items waiting too long
- Respects your Do Not Disturb settings

### Track Your Progress

See how much you're actually consuming. Weekly stats and streaks keep you motivated to clear your queue.

### Beautiful Organization

Auto-categorization sorts your content by type (articles, videos, images, books). Add your own tags and filters to find things fast.

## How It Works

1. **See something interesting?** Tap share and choose rem
2. **Preview appears** with title, image, and description
3. **Get reminded** based on your schedule and priorities
4. **Mark as read** when done or archive to save for later
5. **Watch your stats grow** as you build the habit


## Design Philosophy

rem is designed to feel calm, not cluttered:

- **iOS-inspired minimalism** — clean lines and thoughtful whitespace
- **Monochromatic palette** — black, white, and subtle grays
- **No emojis, no noise** — icons and typography only
- **Dark mode native** — easy on the eyes, day or night
