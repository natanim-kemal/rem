# AGENTS.md
# Guidance for agentic coding in this repo

## Repo overview
- Primary app: Flutter/Dart in `apps/mobile`.
- Backend: Convex functions in `convex/` (TypeScript).
- Root `package.json` is only for Convex CLI tasks.
- Hooks: `lefthook.yml` runs Dart format and commit message validation.

## Build, lint, test commands

### Root (Convex)
```bash
# Install Convex CLI (if not already)
npm install

# Start local Convex dev server
npx convex dev

# Generate Convex types
npx convex codegen

# Typecheck Convex functions
npx convex typecheck

# Deploy Convex (production)
npx convex deploy
```

### Flutter app (run from `apps/mobile`)
```bash
# Install Flutter deps
flutter pub get

# Run app (device/simulator)
flutter run

# Analyze
flutter analyze --fatal-infos

# Format
dart format .

# Format check (CI-style)
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .

# Code generation
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Watch codegen
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Unit/widget tests
flutter test

# Coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Run a single test
```bash
# Single Dart test file
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Single test by name (file contains name)
flutter test test/widget_test.dart -n "ItemCard displays title"
```

## Hooks and commit rules
- `lefthook.yml` pre-commit runs Dart formatting on staged `apps/mobile/**/*.dart`.
- `lefthook.yml` also runs `scripts/no-comments-in-added.ps1` on pre-commit.
- Commit messages are validated by `scripts/validate-commit-msg.ps1`.
- Follow Conventional Commits (see `docs/05-DEVELOPMENT-STANDARDS.md`).

## Style guidelines (Dart/Flutter)

### Formatting and linting
- Use `dart format` for all Dart files.
- Lints come from `apps/mobile/analysis_options.yaml` (flutter_lints).
- Prefer `const` widgets and `final` locals where possible.

### Imports
- Order: Dart SDK, package imports, then relative imports.
- Keep import groups separated by a blank line.

Example:
```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import '../providers/auth_provider.dart';
```

### Naming and files
- Classes: PascalCase (`ItemRepository`).
- Methods/variables: lowerCamelCase (`fetchItems`).
- Private identifiers: prefix `_`.
- Files and folders: snake_case (`item_repository.dart`).
- Widgets should describe purpose: `ItemCard`, `AddItemSheet`.

### State management (Riverpod)
- Providers live in `apps/mobile/lib/providers/`.
- Prefer `Notifier`/`AsyncValue` patterns for async work.
- Keep `ref.watch`/`ref.listen` logic in `build` or in notifier classes.

### Data layer
- Local data uses Drift in `apps/mobile/lib/data/`.
- Keep DB access in repository/services; UI should not query DB directly.

### Error handling
- Prefer explicit error states (`AsyncValue.error`) instead of silent failures.
- Log with `debugPrint` for recoverable issues.
- For user-facing errors, surface friendly messages in UI widgets.

### UI consistency
- Theme is defined in `apps/mobile/lib/presentation/theme/app_theme.dart`.
- Use theme colors/typography instead of hard-coded values.
- Use Cupertino widgets where existing screens do (see `HomeScreen`).

### Performance
- Use `ListView.builder` / `SliverList` for long lists.
- Avoid recomputing heavy work in `build`; cache or memoize when needed.

## Style guidelines (Convex TypeScript)
- Functions live in `convex/`.
- Always validate args with `v.*` validators.
- Always check auth with `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`.
- Use indexes for queries (`withIndex`, `withSearchIndex`).
- Throw explicit errors for auth/validation/ownership issues.
- Keep handlers small; prefer helper functions for shared logic.

## JS browser extension (if touching `extension/`)
- Keep scripts simple, no build step is configured.
- Prefer small helpers and clear error handling.

## Docs and standards to follow
- `docs/05-DEVELOPMENT-STANDARDS.md`: detailed naming, testing, and Convex rules.
- `docs/03-CICD.md`: CI pipeline and build steps.

## Cursor/Copilot rules
- No `.cursor/rules`, `.cursorrules`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` found.

## Safety and hygiene
- Do not commit secrets (`.env`, keys, tokens).
- Avoid editing generated files in `build/` or `.dart_tool/`.
- Keep changes focused; match existing project patterns.
